psql model_utils -c "select * from training"





1. add github repo to project.
2. try with different data set
3. try with regresion data set (new notebok?)





split traing and eval into separate notebooks?  or make a separate eval notebook available

i need an integration test tab...based on model version + a data set.  what is the data set and where is it defined?  Just use eval dataset?  Remove label?  or have an integration tab.
